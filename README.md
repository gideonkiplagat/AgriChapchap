## Enhancing Kenyan Farmersâ€™ Livelihoods through an Integrated Agricultural Platform
Kenyan farmers face significant challenges that hinder their prosperity and economic well-being. These challenges include falling prices, diminishing income, and limited access to essential resources. The rise of intermediaries exacerbates these issues, leaving farmers with little returns for their hard work. To address this, we propose the creation of an integrated mobile platform tailored to the needs of Kenyan farmers.

### Market Price Transparency.
Farmers in Kenya often lack access to real-time information about prevailing market prices for their produce, which limits their ability to make informed selling decisions. Agrichapchap aims to address this issue by providing up-to-date price data across various regions, enabling farmers to identify and choose the highest bidder for their produce. This service will be accessible through the Agrichapchap mobile app and USSD, ensuring broad accessibility even in areas with limited internet connectivity.
